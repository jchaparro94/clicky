## Creation

This App was created using React. Taking advantage of the app.js and index.css files created when running React, I kept it simple and did all my codining within the App.js files.


### Difficulties

Issues I had during this assignment were all due to overthinking. I began with multiple files that would have each taken care of a different portion of the app. After some talk with other classmates and a TA, I decided to do it all off of one page (App.js) and keep it as simple as I could. 

### Learnings

I've learned to build out my app the way I want it to look and once that is done, focus on the functionality of the app.
